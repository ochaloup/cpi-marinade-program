= Marinade CPI calls

This is about to try to call Marinade programs

1) use https://github.com/marinade-finance/marinade-onchain-helper. This requires the anchor in version `0.18.0`.
  It's problematic as it's old version, plus old versions of the Anchor were yanked (see https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/issues/1816#issuecomment-1104098755).
  The example of how to use that calling is nicely shown in the referral program repository https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-referral-program.
  See https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-referral-program/blob/b3dd8038aa8f3831b7bb97e9deb5ca0aa06c540c/programs/marinade-referral/src/instructions/deposit_sol.rs#L57
2) use https://docs.rs/marinade-cpi/. It's automatically generated code from the marinade IDL. The repository of the generator is at
   https://github.com/saber-hq/anchor-gen, the marinade code is generated from https://github.com/saber-hq/anchor-gen/tree/master/examples/marinade-cpi
   Example of usage is at link:./cpi-marinade/[].
3) use marinade-sdk (`marinade-rust-sdk` as it should be renamed in future) from https://github.com/marinade-finance/marinade-sdk
   Example of usage is at link:./sdk-marinade/[].
