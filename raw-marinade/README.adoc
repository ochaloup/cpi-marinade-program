= Solana RAW instruction calling

To call Marinade liquid staking program
https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-program
with RAW instruction call.

The raw means to use the `solana_program` SDK without use of the Anchor
support and its CPI or IDL apis.

The invocation requires the Anchor discriminator which is a `[u8;8]` sized
and it's at the start of the instruction data passed to the program.
With that the Anchor may differentiate what function is called at the program.

== How to get information for RAW CPI call to Marinade

To find out how to call the program method with raw txn call
we need to know what is the discriminator (method identifier).
The way to do it is to work with the Anchor program
to compile and extend it.

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-program
cd liquid-staking-program


cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor avm --locked --force

avm install latest
avm use latest

anchor expand

cat .anchor/expanded-macros/marinade-finance/marinade-finance-*.rs
# search for string 'match sighash {'

cat .anchor/expanded-macros/marinade-finance/marinade-finance-*.rs |\
  grep -B 1 '__private::__global::deposit('

== How to get Marinade IDL json and typescript

=== IDL json and typescriptts


If we want to get the Anchor IDL (`./target/idl`) for Marinade `liquid-staking-program`
then only version `0.18.0` and lower works.

[source,sh]
----
# to cloned Marinade anchor project
cd liquid-staking-program/

avm install 0.18.0
avm use 0.18.0
anchor --version

# if the version is the latest one then we can call the anchor directly where it's installed
~/.avm/bin/anchor-0.18.0 --version

~/.avm/bin/anchor-0.18.0 build
----

With that we built the Marinade `liquid-staking-program` project and got generated
`.so` files under `liquid-staking-program/target/deploy`
and we get the `idl` under `liquid-staking-program/target/idl`
and the typescript `ts` under `liquid-staking-program/target/types`.

The output of generation is under `./types` folder of this project.

=== IDL typescript ts

To get solely the typescript types of the instructions and accounts could be generated from the Anchor sources
via command `anchor idl parse`.

The output of command is under `./types` folder.


[source,sh]
----
# to cloned Marinade anchor project
cd liquid-staking-program/

anchor idl parse -f programs/marinade-finance/src/lib.rs -t idl/marinade_finance.ts
